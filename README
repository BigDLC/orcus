This should not be talking directly to the database.

Instead, it needs to load its objects via REST interface.  

It needs to have its own authentication system as well.


INSTALL:

- Create an empty database named orcus_dev
- Setup the config/database.yml file with the proper username and password for your mysql database
- cd into the project directory
- Type 
	rake db:migrate
	rake db:fixtures:load
	rails server start
