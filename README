ORCUS

# This project is not yet operational...

Orcus is a distributed automation system, much like AutoSys, UC4, or Tidal.  Its 
designed as a 'distributed cron' where one node can have tasks that depend on tasks 
occurring on other nodes.  Tasks can be retried multiple times, and if they fail, 
they notify the appropriate people. 

This orcus project is the web front end for managing the system.
The orcus-client is the client side node app that communicates with the database.

== The Design:

Nodes are grouped into "pools" that can be associated with "actions".  An action 
can occur on one or all nodes in a pool.  "Chains" are connected chains of actions
in a parent-child relationship.  The child action occurs after the parent action.  
Child actions can be set to run either after a successful parent or after a failed 
parent action.

== TODOS and Design issues:

- Children can have only one parent action.  But parents can have multiple children.


== Getting started:

Create an empty database and point the web portion at it via editing the 
config/database.rb file.
Run "rake db:reset"
