ORCUS

Orcus is a distributed automation system.  Its designed as a 'distributed cron' 
where one node can have tasks that depend on tasks occurring on other nodes, tasks 
get retried multiple times, and if they fail, they notify the appropriate people.

This orcus project is the web front end for managing the system.
The orcus-client is the client side node app that communicates with the database.

== Getting started:

Create an empty database and point the web portion at it via editing the 
config/database.rb file.
Run "rake db:reset"
